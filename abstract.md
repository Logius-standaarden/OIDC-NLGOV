The OpenID Connect protocol defines an identity federation system that allows
a Relying Party to request and receive authentication and profile information
about an End-User.

This specification profiles the OpenID Connect protocol to increase baseline
security, provide greater interoperability, and structure deployments in a
manner specifically applicable to (but not limited to) government and public
service domains in The Netherlands.

This profile builds on top of, and inherits all properties of, the NL GOV
Assurance profile for OAuth 2.0 [[OAuth2.NLGov]].
